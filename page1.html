        as i am a die hard football fan i have a keen interest in tech<br>
        and all things creative i love to meet all kinds of people<br>
        as this can make yourself grow as a person and open you up<br>
        to new things, just like i happen to get into coding with <br>
        a project called code nation during this time i have created this webpage<br>
        i have grown in knowlage and new friendships i am looking <br>
        forward to carrying on this journey and see what i can become<br>
        in the tech world.

           <h2 class=white>How i got here</h2>
    <b>
        <p class= blue>
        Let me tell you How i got to this point<br>
        only 3weeks ago i knew nothing on programming<br>
        but always would watch people create projects<br>
        so i thought i would place this idea into action<br> 
        as i searched i came across a course named code nation<br>
        this was a 3week python html and css course<br> 
        where we created small projects like fun games, tasks<br>
        and currently this website you are visiting now :)
        </p>
    </b>

        <h2 class=yellow>Where i hope to be</h2>
    <b>
        <p class= white>
        Where i would like to take my programming skills<br>
        hopefully to the moon my soul mission would be to <br>
        grow and learn as much as i can in the coming time<br>
        and eventually be able to apply my skills into a major<br>
        project that contribute to something special that i can <br>
        be proud and make my children proud of me.
